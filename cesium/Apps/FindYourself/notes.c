Find Yourself:
  WebPage-based:
  Google Maps APIs;
  video editting;
  HTML5 full screen;

[Script]
Script A:
  In morden society, 变化快，选择多，people easily get lost. 
  This webapp is a fully functional one, which will help you find yourself again, for free.
  Put on your earphone, and buckle up. [press launch app]

  [lonely figure / confused figure in a big city]

  I know, 
  Sometimes, it is hard to find yourself;
  because, the world is so big and YOU ARE SO SMALL;
  Indeed, 
  This is you. on the map; a small blue dot; 
  Now, let_s zoom out...
  This is the city you live in, with xx population; you are only one of them;
  This is the country, with xx GDP each year; how much do you contribute to that?
  This is earth, area, how many percentage have been covered by your foorprint?
  If we keep zooming out...
  [earth to universe]... 
  In this scene, you are not even qualified for a tiny pixel;
  YOU ARE SO SMALL;
  ...
  However, does this really make it hard to find you?
  Not really, 
  When searching in a well-structued space, size is not a big issue; Uniqueness is;
    and luckily enough that is exactly what you have, by nature.
  The universe is endless, but we can still find you ...
  [universe to earth]
  in time coordinate: AD <2017 >... Earth Time.
  Oart ...
  Milky Way...
  Solar ...
  Earth ...
  City ...
  the blue dot/you;
  The universe is amazing and you are part of it.
  You could be small but you are always unique.
  You are the only one like you in the sea of infinity.
  Hopefully, this could guide you to find yourself.

Script B:
  [when user open this url again]
  ... similar part 1 as Script A ...
  [earth to universe]
  ok, probably, I have to say that you are totally unimportant to the whole universe; 
  however,
  when it comes to the Milky Way Galaxy, you become xxx times more important;
  when it comes to the Solar System, ...
  when it comes to earth, ...
  when it comes to your city, ...
  when it comes to your company, ...
  when it comes to your friends, ...
  when it comes to your family, ...
  when it comes to yourself, ...
  You are not small, so it is not hard at all to find you.
